#### Why does this project exist ?
> TL;DR No real reason, I like git

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.5;padding: 10px;">
  The reason I created this project is mainly a practical one. Indeed pretty much everything here are exercises given to me as homework assignment and material that I might need during the current university semester.

  Furthermore I often delete things I shouldn't, thus saving them here is a good idea. I have will have a table with the exercises which can be easily access and also try to have some templates
